Read me file for assignment #2

In this assignment I created 2 functions. One is the decrypting function and the other
one is the encrypting. At the beginning I had troubles going around the array of the
alphabet, but in the end I solved the problem with a while loop and an if statement.
When the user needs to choose what operation to make [encrypting or decrypting] if he/she
writes a letter that is not an option, a message is going to appear.
