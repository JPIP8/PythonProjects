In this small project, I increased my knowledge in the use of dictionaries, how to process a dataset, and how to produce a summary of statistics using dictionaries. I read from a CSV file and processed it for the reason of giving statistical results for the user. At first, I was thinking about making 3 different dictionaries, one for each specie. I had some troubles managing the structure for "pretty" printing the results. In the end, I made a change, I made the calculations and stored the results in one dictionary. As a result, the manipulation of the data was easier.
