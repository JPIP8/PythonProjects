Read me file for assignment #3

This assignment was similar to the last one, but it had its additions that made the encryption more fun. What I did in order to try my code is that i created a text file with the name "word" that said "hello this is a test for the encryption decryption assignment!". After I ran the code, another file was created with the name "word_en" and this file said "khoor wklv lv d whvw iru wkh hqfubswlrq ghfubswlrq dvvljqphqw!" which is the original file but encrypted with our key. In addition, for testing the decryption part, I opened my own encrypted file called "word_en" and the program did a decryption. In the end, I ended up with a file named "word_en_dec" and inside it said exactly the same as the original "word" text file. Meaning that, my assignment runs smoothly :)
