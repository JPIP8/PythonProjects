# PythonProjects

This is a folder of some projects that I developed using python.

I have been working with the Python programming language for several years, and it's the one that has interested me the most throughout 
my professional and academic career. I have used Python to develop data science projects, in which I have used the Pandas library to open 
different types of files, clean and analyze data, and finally, I have used the MatPlotLib and Seaborn libraries to create charts that help 
interpret the results more effectively.
